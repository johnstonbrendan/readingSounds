I almost fell backwards and broke my legs while staring at all this, for to the left, as we entered, not far from the porter's alcove, an enormous dog upon a chain was painted upon the wall, and above him this inscription, in capitals:                               BEWARE THE DOG.  My companions laughed, but I plucked up my courage and did not hesitate, but went on and examined the entire wall.  There was a scene in a slave market, the tablets hanging from the slaves' necks, and Trimalchio himself, wearing his hair long, holding a caduceus in his hand, entering Rome, led by the hand of Minerva.  Then again the painstaking artist had depicted him casting up accounts, and still again, being appointed steward; everything being explained by inscriptions.  Where the walls gave way to the portico, Mercury was shown lifting him up by the chin, to a tribunal placed on high.  Near by stood Fortune with her horn of plenty, and the three Fates, spinning golden flax.  I also took note of a group of runners, in the portico, taking their exercise under the eye of an instructor, and in one corner was a large cabinet, in which was a very small shrine containing silver Lares, a marble Venus, and a golden casket by no means small, which held, so they told us, the first shavings of Trimalchio's beard.  I asked the hall-porter what pictures were in the middle hall.  \"The Iliad and the Odyssey,\" he replied, \"and the gladiatorial games given under Laenas.\"  There was no time in which to examine them all.
